## Project objectives

Develop bicycle-sharing prediction models

## Tasks
- Data processing: Check for data anomalies, and handle missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers.
- Prepare data for model building: Encode categorical features, and scale data.
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze distributions and correlations.
- Select the most important features.
- Build models to predict daily demand for bicycle sharing service using Scikit-learn, hyperparameter optimization algorithms (HyperOpt), and implement pipelines to streamline workflow and automate repetitive tasks.
- Achieve an accuracy rate of 90% on test data.
